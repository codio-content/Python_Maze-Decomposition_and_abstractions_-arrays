Let's see how we actually work with l in our code.

## The `print` function
This function lets you write things to the screen. If you want to add a new line afterwards (as we are doing in the examples), you set the second argument to be `true`.

## Array Example 1
The first example shows one way of creating an array. We first create an empty array using 

```python
array1 = []
```

Then we manually set array values on the following lines. Finally, we print them all out in a loop.

## Array Example 2
The second example shows how we can create and populate an array using a single line of code. We then print out the results in the same way.

```javascript
array2 = ['Mary', 'had' , 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
```

## The `array1.length` function
If you look at the condition within the loops, you can see we use a special function of the array.

```javascript
array1.length
```
This tells us the number of elements in the array called `array1`. This way we don't have to know in advance how many elements there are.

This approach is used a lot in coding, so it's worth remembering.
